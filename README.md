The book discusses various design principles such as SOLID principles, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It), and others. Each principle is explained in detail, with examples demonstrating how to apply them in C++ code.



## Design Patterns

The core of the book revolves around design patterns. It covers classical design patterns such as Visitor, Strategy, Observer, Prototype, Erasure, Singleton and many more. Each pattern is accompanied by code examples illustrating its implementation in C++.



## Example Applications
